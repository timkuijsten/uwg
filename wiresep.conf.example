# sample wiresep configuration file, see wiresep.conf(5)

# This is an example of a server listening on the public ip 198.51.100.7 port
# 1234. It uses the tun0 device with the internal ip addresses 2001:db8::7
# and 172.16.0.1 and allows communication with the peer Jane and Joe. Jane is
# allowed to use any source ip, while Joe may only use 2001:db8::4 or
# 172.16.0.11/30 as the source ip of his packets. The private key for the tun0
# interface can be stored in the default location: /etc/wiresep/tun0.key and
# must be generated with wiresep-keygen(8).
